          <h2>About</h2>

          <p>
            Heritage Capital was created to stand alongside entrepreneurs who have built resilient businesses over time—
            through vision, dedication, and hard work.
          </p>

          <p>
            We look for owner-led companies where a generational transition represents an important moment:
            not an ending, but a new phase to be navigated with respect, continuity, and method.
          </p>

          <p>
            We support the entrepreneur and management team with practical capabilities:
            process improvement, organizational structure, disciplined cash management, and day-to-day decision support—
            always with deep respect for the company’s identity and history.
          </p>

          <h2>Strategy</h2>
          <p>
            Our strategy focuses on small and medium-sized businesses with solid fundamentals, recurring revenues,
            and long-standing relationships with their customers.
            <br><br>
            We operate in fragmented industries, where growth can come from strengthening each business and, when appropriate,
            from gradual and coherent integration paths.
            <br><br>
            We select smaller companies—often at a point of generational transition—with the goal of preserving their identity
            and supporting their evolution over the long term.

          <p>
            Our approach starts by recognizing the value that is already there.
            The companies we join are businesses that work—built over time through good decisions,
            strong relationships, and deep knowledge of their sector.
          </p>
          <p>
            After our entry, our priority is continuity and stability—supporting the company into its next phase
            with care, gradual change, and a strong sense of responsibility.
            Every decision is taken with respect for the company’s history, its people, and the context in which it operates.
          </p>
          <p>
            We contribute time, presence, and method—bringing operational and managerial capabilities to support the organization over time,
            without forcing change. We believe in an orderly evolution, consistent with the company’s identity and focused on long-term resilience.

          <p>
            Heritage Capital was born from the meeting of two complementary paths.
            <br><br>
            On one side: hands-on operational experience—industrial processes and day-to-day work alongside businesses.
            On the other: a finance track developed in complex international M&A environments.
            <br><br>
            This complementarity helps us approach entrepreneurial challenges with balance: vision and discipline,
            respect for company history, and the ability to guide its evolution.
            <br><br>
            We share the same mindset: pragmatism, responsibility, and direct involvement—always with the goal of preserving what works
            and helping the business grow over time.
